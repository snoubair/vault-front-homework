## Objectives

Your challenge is to build a simple and intuitive interface for searching through a list of notifications.

### Figma Design

Here’s the design you’ll be implementing: **[Figma prototype](https://www.figma.com/proto/AwC58Mqda2ZOjqzadPdiso/LES---Front-end-homework?page-id=&node-id=1-4741&p=f&t=Dx21H0F2ytviGHvl-0&scaling=min-zoom&content-scaling=fixed&starting-point-node-id=1%3A4741)**

All the available material can be found from this link: **[Figma components](https://www.figma.com/design/AwC58Mqda2ZOjqzadPdiso/LES---Front-end-homework?node-id=0-1)**

The password will be provided to you by email.

### Code

You'll be given a backend with a search endpoint to handle server-side operations and a minimal frontend that you'll enhance.

What we expect from you:

- Ensure the frontend nicely matches the Figma design.
- Create any necessary components and feel free to restructure the file architecture.
- Improve the Typescript types, so they are strictier & helpful.
- 🎁 **Bonus:** Add code quality tools (linting, formatting).
- 🎁 **Bonus:** A GitHub Action to automate code quality checks.
- 🎁 **Bonus:** Any other cool improvements you can think of!

> [!NOTE]
> We've **intentionally left some bugs/issues in the code**—happy debugging! 🥳

### TODOs:

- Add unit tests for the components
- Use react query library to fetch the data from the backend
- Fix hero icons loading to avoid flicker on virtualization
- Fix icons desing to match the figma
- Handle non supported currency use case
- Add a generic empty/loading state component
- Optimize queries: if dd not found then ddd won't be found neither
